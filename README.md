# R2 package image storage

Package image uploads use Cloudflare R2's S3-compatible API. Set these server-side
variables in `.env.local` and in the deployment environment:

```env
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
R2_BUCKET_NAME=
R2_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<public-bucket-domain>
```

Configure the bucket's public domain in Cloudflare and set `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
to that HTTPS origin (or origin plus path prefix). `R2_ENDPOINT` is the private
S3 API endpoint and cannot be used as the image URL. The public domain preserves
the existing behavior where package images can be displayed from their saved
URLs. Never expose the R2 access key or secret in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.

Invoice attachments use a separate **private** R2 bucket. Set a bucket-scoped
R2 API token with object read/write permission for that bucket in server-only
environment variables:

```env
R2_INVOICE_BUCKET_NAME=
R2_INVOICE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
R2_INVOICE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

Invoice storage reuses `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` and `R2_ENDPOINT`, but not the package
image bucket or its public URL. Do not enable public access or configure a
public domain for the invoice bucket. Downloads are served only through the
authenticated application route.

# Finance

The Finance page is available to admins and managers. Weekly reports use
Monday–Sunday; monthly and custom date ranges are also available. Invoice
revenue and pending balances are grouped by invoice issue date, while advances
are grouped by payment date. Amounts remain separated by currency.

Set a default cost per booking on each package. Linked invoices prefill that
cost and allow an override; the saved cost and payment exchange rates are
snapshotted. Finance reports show package revenue, direct package cost, and
profit by package, and include direct costs in expenses. Manually entered
expenses can include a private PDF or image receipt stored in the invoice R2
bucket.

Deploy the Firestore indexes in `firestore.indexes.json` when applying schema
changes:

```sh
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```
